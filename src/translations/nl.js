    TRX holders can apply to become a super delegate by using the account management function, and vote for candidates. 
    Each account can update current voter information and also is allowed to vote for multiple candidates. 
    The maximum number of votes is less than or equal to the number of TRX users hold each time. 
    (If you have certain sum of TRX, you can vote less than or equal to certain number of votes). 
    The result of votes will be calculated based on the final voter information of every account in each
     voting cycle of which the time is from 00:00 to 24:00. TRX holders with the most votes will become super delegate. 
     Every transaction made in the network is required to be validated by all SuperDelegates, and some bonuses will be getted.
     TRX will not be consumed in the process of super delegate application and voting.
